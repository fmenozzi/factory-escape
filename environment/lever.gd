# TODO: This is pretty hacky; we have to include this method because the player
#       script assumes in its _on_attack_connected() method that its attack is
#       connecting with an enemy, and therefore calls the enemy's take_hit()
#       method. Consider a refactor that allows the player to use attacks as
#       interactions and change _on_attack_connected() (and this method)
#       accordingly.
